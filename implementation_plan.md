# Implementation Plan: Generating Comprehensive Case Study Solutions

## Objective
To provide a structured, step-by-step plan for transforming a single-line case study problem statement into a detailed solution document, accompanying data sheets, diagram prompts, and high-fidelity wireframes, mirroring the depth and quality of the provided reference case studies (Biz-Genie.md, Credit-Pesa.md, Emerge.md).

## Guiding Principles
*   **Comprehensive:** Cover all typical sections of a robust product case study.
*   **Structured:** Follow a logical flow from problem understanding to final solution details.
*   **Actionable:** Provide clear steps with examples and guidance on execution.
*   **Tool-Agnostic (but LLM-leveraged):** While recommending LLMs and specific tools (Whimsical, HTML/CSS frameworks), the core process is adaptable.
*   **Deliverable-Focused:** Each phase contributes directly to the required outputs (`final_solution.md`, `sheets.md`, `whimsical.md`, `wireframes.html`).

## Target Deliverables Checklist
Upon completion of this plan, the following should be generated:
- [ ] `final_solution.md`: Detailed case study solution document.
- [ ] `sheets.md`: Markdown file containing all relevant tabular data.
- [ ] `whimsical.md`: Markdown file containing detailed prompts for Whimsical AI.
- [ ] `wireframes/`: Folder containing HTML files for high-fidelity wireframes.

## Technology & Tools Recommendation
*   **LLM:** Google Gemini (or similar advanced model) for research, brainstorming, content generation, persona simulation, and prompt refinement.
*   **Diagramming:** Whimsical (specifically leveraging its AI features).
*   **Tables:** Markdown (for `sheets.md`), easily transferable to Google Sheets.
*   **Wireframing:** HTML, CSS, potentially JavaScript. Frameworks like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) or concepts from [21st.dev](https://21st.dev/) for modern aesthetics (requires front-end development skills or LLM assistance for code generation).
*   **Document Editor:** Any Markdown editor.

## Implementation Phases

---

### Phase 1: Understand & Define (Est. Time: 1-2 Hours)
**Goal:** Deconstruct the problem, define scope, and outline the final solution structure.
