## ▼ Problem Statement

In India, millions struggle with early symptoms of depression, often unaware or hesitant to seek help due to stigma and limited access to mental health resources. These individuals experience social withdrawal, decreased motivation, and difficulty maintaining basic self-care. Traditional interventions may be expensive, inaccessible, or carry a social stigma.

### Background

Depression is a major health concern in India, with a significant portion of the population experiencing early symptoms. Early intervention is crucial to prevent worsening conditions. Emerge with Mario aims to bridge this gap by offering a low-barrier, culturally relevant mobile app that empowers individuals to address early signs of depression and promote self-care practices.

## ▼ Common pitfalls of existing solution

*   Limited experience before a paywall shows up.
*   Psychiatrists and psychologist consultations are expensive
*   Therapy is expensive too but people find it hard to trust a therapist
*   Existing mental health services in India often face limitations in funding, staffing, and accessibility.
*   Existing mental health apps lack a focus on early intervention specifically for the Indian context such as stigma eradication and mental health awareness.

## ▼ Secondary Research

### High Level data

In India, the prevalence of mental health disorders has increased steadily in recent years. According to a 2023 study published in Cureus Journal, India is dealing with a high burden of mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders. **Over 200 million people are** estimated to be living with poor mental health conditions. In the next ten years, we expect this burden to double, with every household in India having **at least one member attempting to cope with mental illness**. [Source]

### Mental Health Industry in India

*   In 2024, the mental health market in India is expected to generate **₹94.35 billion** in revenue. By 2028, the market size is predicted to reach **₹100.60 billion**, with revenue growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of **1.62%** from 2024 to 2028. As a percentage of the entire population, **₹0.99k** in income is created per person in 2024. [Source]

    [Chart Description: Graph showing Average Revenue Per Patient (ARPP) in India for mental health categories (Total, Anxiety/Sleep, Depressive, Psychotic) from 2016-2028. Shows trends and projections, with Total ARPP projected around $10.77 USD in 2028. Source: Statista Market Insights]
*   In the financial year 2024-25, the **mental healthcare budget is only 1 percent** of the total healthcare budget. This is very low considering the size and seriousness of the problem. The treatment gap for mental disorders in India ranges from 70-92 percent, meaning a vast majority of those affected do not receive the care they need. [Source]
*   The World Health Organisation estimates that India will suffer **economic losses of 1.03 trillion** 2010 dollars between 2012 and 2030 as a result of mental health issues. [Source]

### ▼ Population related concerns

*   Population Basis for India: Out of 1.4 billion individuals, **1 in 8 suffer** from mental health problems, or a base of 175 million. Additionally, there is a **severe shortage of psychiatrists (0.75 per 100,000 people)**, which results in wait periods for depression that are reported to be as high as **12 months in metro areas** and **2-3 years in non-metros**. [Source]
*   According to the guidelines there should be **at least three psychiatrists per one lakh population**. In developed countries, this number is around **6.6 psychiatrists per 100,000 people**. And as per report submitted by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare in August 2023, there are **2,840 accredited clinical psychologists** in India. [Source]
*   A survey by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) indicates that approximately **42.5% of Indian corporate sector workers experience depression or general anxiety disorder**. Nearly 80% of workers acknowledged that they had taken a two-week leave of absence from work in the previous year due to stress, anxiety, or poor mental health. [Source]

### Mental Health & Awareness- Why important || Challenges Gaps in the Indian market

*   Mental health is an intrinsic part of overall well-being. Yet, the topic has often been relegated to the shadows. The saying, "There is no health without mental health," reminds us of the profound connection between mind and body.
*   In comparison to Western countries where mental health services are more integrated and accessible, **India struggles** with a significant gap in mental health literacy and service availability, particularly in rural areas. Low and Middle-Income countries (LMICs) bear a significant burden due to factors like availability, affordability, and various influences. Stigma continues to be a formidable barrier, delaying or preventing effective treatment and social acceptance.
*   Mental health issues span a lifetime - from autism and cognitive impairment in childhood, to depression, anxiety, substance misuse, and psychosis in adulthood, and ultimately to dementia in old age. Globally, mental illnesses constitute 15% of the disease burden. India, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), has **one of the world's largest populations grappling with mental health issues in various forms**.
*   The **key challenges** faced by mental health professionals in India include the severe shortage of personnel, uneven distribution of services, inadequate infrastructure and resources, stigma and lack of awareness, limited integration with primary care, and insufficient funding, all of which contribute to the significant treatment gap for mental health issues in the country

| Therapist                | Supply needed (per global standard) | India's actual supply* | Deficit |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :------ |
| Psychiatrist             | 13k                                 | 3.5k                   | **9.5k**  |
| Clinical Psychologists   | 20k                                 | 1k                     | **19k**   |
| Psychiatric Social Workers | 35k                                 | 1k                     | **34k**   |
| Psychiatric Nurses       | 30k                                 | 1.5k                   | **28.5k** |

*   **High-quality services** are hard to scale and **Stigma** still exists in large parts of the country and in most social structures
*   **Demand vs Supply** is the biggest problem in India [Source] - And below picture shows what is not working currently and what is required in mental health model.

[Graphic Description: Comparison showing issues with current mental health models (Demand: Affordability, Margins, Outcomes, TAM, Diagnosis; Supply: Quality, Access) versus needs for a winning model (Affordable/AI, Low cost supply, Tracking, International reach, Diagnosis/Therapies, Scalable quality, Diverse therapists).]

That Mental health apps and online platforms are becoming increasingly popular, offering a range of services such as self-help resources, mood tracking, and virtual support groups. These digital solutions provide individuals with tools to manage their mental health and seek support whenever needed. The convenience and anonymity offered by these platforms appeal to a wide range of customers, particularly the younger generation.

| **PHQ-9 Score** | Depression Level             | Starting Level**                 |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| 0-4             | No Depression                | Peaceful Glade (tutorial level)  |
| 5-9             | Mild Depression              | Gloomy Grove                     |

### Important Considerations:

*   **Progression:** While the starting level is based on the PHQ-9 score, players should be able to progress to the more difficult zone of the individual tasks inside a level. This allows them to learn and practice various coping skills.
*   **Focus on Mastery:** The core gameplay should focus on teaching coping mechanisms and building mental resilience, not on difficulty gating content based solely on PHQ-9 score.

**Encouragement:** Provide encouraging messages and support throughout the game, regardless of the starting level.

## ▼ Success Metrics

Our immediate priority is to build a strong, user-centric product that effectively addresses the mental health needs of our target audience. While monetization is not our day one target, it is part of our medium-term strategy.

**North star Metrics - Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU):** The number of users engaging with the app on a daily and monthly basis to understand active user base.

**MVP Launch Focus: User Engagement**

For the MVP launch, the primary focus will be on User Engagement Metrics to validate core functionalities and user interest. These metrics will help us understand if users are finding the app valuable and integrating it into their routines.

*   **Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU):** Track active user base and app usage frequency.
*   **Session Duration:** Analyze average time spent per session to understand user engagement depth.
*   **Retention Rate:** Measure how many users return after 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months to assess user stickiness.

We will monitor these core metrics to identify areas for improvement and iterate on the MVP based on user behavior.

**Level wise few metrics:**

*   L1: No. of happy moods recorded / DAU
*   L2: No. of positive mood transitions / Anonymous call with a community member
*   For all levels: **Task completed/Per User session:** The number of Task completed by user every active session
