*   **Decision 1:** Are High-Relevance Offers Available? (Score > Threshold)
    *   **Yes:** Proceed to Process 5.
    *   **No:** End Process (No notification sent).
*   **Process 5:** Select Top Offer & Craft Personalized Message (using NLG).
*   **Process 6:** Send Targeted Push Notification.
*   **Process 7:** Record Interaction Data (Sent, Opened, Clicked, Ignored) - Feedback loop for AI models.
*   **End:** Process Complete.

**Style:** Use standard flowchart shapes (rectangles for processes, diamonds for decisions, ovals for start/end). Use arrows to show flow direction. Keep text concise.

## Prompt 3: Sequence Diagram - AI Chatbot Interaction with Agent Handoff (Simplified)

**Create a simplified sequence diagram showing a user interacting with the Tickit AI Chatbot, leading to a handoff to a human agent.**

*   **Participants:** `User`, `Tickit App (UI)`, `AI Chatbot`, `Backend System`, `Live Agent System`, `Human Agent`.
*   **Sequence:**
    1.  `User` -> `Tickit App (UI)`: Sends initial query (e.g., "Points missing").
    2.  `Tickit App (UI)` -> `AI Chatbot`: Forwards query.
    3.  `AI Chatbot` -> `Backend System`: Requests necessary user/transaction data.
    4.  `Backend System` --> `AI Chatbot`: Returns data.
    5.  `AI Chatbot` --> `Tickit App (UI)`: Provides initial response (attempts automated resolution).
    6.  `User` -> `Tickit App (UI)`: Sends follow-up indicating need for human help (e.g., "Need to speak to someone").
    7.  `Tickit App (UI)` -> `AI Chatbot`: Forwards message.
    8.  `AI Chatbot` -> `AI Chatbot`: Identifies escalation need.
    9.  `AI Chatbot` -> `Live Agent System`: Initiates handoff with context (user info, chat summary).
    10. `AI Chatbot` --> `Tickit App (UI)`: Informs user of transfer ("Connecting you to an agent...").
    11. `Live Agent System` -> `Human Agent`: Assigns ticket & provides context.
    12. `Human Agent` -> `Tickit App (UI)`: Connects and starts conversation via the App UI.

**Style:** Use standard sequence diagram notation with lifelines. Focus on the essential message exchanges driving the flow from user query to agent connection.

## Prompt 4: Flowchart - AI Fraud Detection Workflow (Conceptual)

**Create a conceptual flowchart for the real-time AI Fraud Detection process.**

*   **Start:** Transaction/Redemption Event Received.
*   **Process 1:** Extract Relevant Features (User ID, Amount, Location, Time, Device, Velocity Metrics, etc.).
*   **Process 2:** Input Features into AI Anomaly Detection Models (Supervised & Unsupervised).
*   **Process 3:** Generate Fraud Risk Score.
*   **Decision 1:** Is Risk Score > High Threshold?
    *   **Yes:** Proceed to Process 4 (Block/Hold).
    *   **No:** Proceed to Decision 2.
*   **Decision 2:** Is Risk Score > Medium Threshold?
    *   **Yes:** Proceed to Process 5 (Flag for Review).
    *   **No:** Proceed to Process 6 (Approve).
*   **Process 4:** Block Transaction / Place Account Hold. Trigger Alert to Fraud Team. End Process.
*   **Process 5:** Flag Transaction for Manual Review. Trigger Alert to Fraud Team. Proceed to Process 6 (Allow transaction for now, review later).
*   **Process 6:** Approve Transaction/Redemption.
*   **Process 7:** Log Event & Score (Feedback loop for model retraining).
*   **End:** Process Complete.

**Style:** Use standard flowchart shapes. Focus on the decision logic based on risk scores.

## Prompt 5: Flowchart - AI Partner Insight Generation (Conceptual)

    *   Association Rule Mining (Find Cross-Promo Affinities).
    *   Performance Analysis (Calculate Redemption Rates, CTR per Segment/Offer).
    *   (Future) Predictive Forecasting.
*   **Process 3:** Generate Insight Summaries & Recommendations (e.g., "Segment X prefers Offer Type Y", "Consider co-promo with Partner Z").
*   **Process 4:** Store Aggregated Insights & Recommendations in Partner Dashboard Database.
*   **Trigger:** Partner Logs into Dashboard.
*   **Process 5:** Retrieve & Display Relevant Insights/Recommendations based on Partner ID & Selected Filters.

*   **Start:** Scheduled Churn Prediction Run (e.g., Daily/Weekly).
*   **Process 1:** Gather Latest User Features (Activity, Spending, Engagement, Profile Data).
*   **Process 2:** Input Features into Trained Churn Prediction Model (e.g., XGBoost).
*   **Process 3:** Generate Churn Probability Score for Each Active User.
*   **Decision 1:** Is Churn Score > High-Risk Threshold?
    *   **Yes:** Proceed to Process 4.
    *   **No:** End Process for this user (or monitor if medium risk).
*   **Process 4:** Tag User as High Churn Risk.
*   **Process 5:** Select Appropriate Proactive Retention Campaign/Offer (Can be AI-driven based on user profile/reason for churn risk).
*   **Process 6:** Trigger Personalized Communication (Email, Push Notification) with Retention Offer.
