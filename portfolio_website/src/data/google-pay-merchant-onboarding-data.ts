    problemStatement: "The existing Google Pay merchant onboarding process is lengthy and complex, leading to significant drop-off rates. This results in missed opportunities for merchant acquisition and platform growth. The goal is to redesign the process to achieve a 50% reduction in onboarding time and a 35% increase in successful merchant activations.",
    context: "This case study focuses on improving the onboarding experience for new merchants joining the Google Pay platform. The context is within Google Pay's ecosystem, specifically targeting the initial signup and verification journey for businesses (likely small to medium-sized) seeking to accept payments via Google Pay, primarily through a digital interface (web or mobile app).",
    scope: {
      inScope: "The end-to-end merchant onboarding flow, starting from initial signup initiation through all required verification steps (e.g., business details, bank account verification, KYC/KYB checks) up to the point where a merchant is successfully activated and ready to receive their first payment. This includes UI/UX redesign of the interface, simplification of the process steps, and improvements to user guidance and communication within the flow.",
      outOfScope: "Features available to merchants post-onboarding (e.g., transaction dashboards, reporting tools, dispute resolution), fundamental changes to the underlying payment processing infrastructure, marketing or advertising campaigns aimed at attracting new merchants, and specific third-party API integrations beyond those essential for core onboarding verification.",
    },
    objectives: [
      "Reduce the average time required for a merchant to complete the onboarding process by 50%.",
      "Increase the rate of successfully activated merchants (those completing onboarding and ready to transact) by 35%.",
      "Improve merchant satisfaction with the onboarding experience, measured through metrics like CSAT surveys or reduced drop-off rates at key onboarding milestones.",
      "Decrease the volume of customer support inquiries and tickets specifically related to onboarding difficulties.",
    ],
    assumptions: [
      "Prospective merchants have readily available access to the necessary business documentation (e.g., registration details, tax IDs) and bank account information required by Google Pay and regulatory bodies.",
      "The primary channel used by merchants for onboarding is a digital interface provided by Google Pay (either a web portal or a mobile application).",
      "Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) regulatory requirements are fixed constraints that the redesigned onboarding flow must adhere to and integrate smoothly.",
      "Google Pay possesses the necessary technical resources and infrastructure capabilities to implement the proposed UI/UX changes and integrate any required third-party validation or verification services.",
