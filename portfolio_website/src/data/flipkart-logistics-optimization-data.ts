    problemStatement: "Flipkart's existing logistics systems lacked sufficiently accurate real-time tracking capabilities and reliable delivery time predictions. This resulted in a suboptimal customer experience, evidenced by a high volume of customer support inquiries related to order status (\"Where is my order?\"). The core challenge was to develop a robust system to provide accurate real-time tracking and significantly improve delivery prediction accuracy, thereby enhancing customer trust and reducing the burden on customer support.",
    context: "Flipkart operates as one of India's largest e-commerce platforms, managing a vast and complex logistics network spanning numerous cities and involving multiple third-party logistics partners alongside its own delivery fleet (eKart). Customers expect timely deliveries and accurate visibility into their order's journey, similar to global e-commerce standards. The product context is the customer-facing tracking interface (web/app) and internal tools used by logistics and support teams.",

  conclusion: { // Content derived from Conclusion section
    summary: "This project aims to significantly enhance Flipkart's customer delivery experience and operational efficiency by tackling the core issues of inaccurate delivery predictions and insufficient tracking visibility. Through a unified real-time data aggregation platform, a dynamic ML-based prediction engine, and improved user interfaces (customer, ops, support), we target a 40% improvement in EDT accuracy and a 25-30% reduction in WISMO contacts. The solution addresses key identified pain points and aligns with market demands for logistical transparency.",

      "Hyper-personalization of EDTs.",
      "Integration of prediction insights into upstream logistics planning.",
      "Expansion of map-based tracking.",
      "Using tracking data for automated claims.",
      "Predictive alerts for potential delivery failures."
