  conclusion: {
    summary: "The AWS Lambda console presents DX challenges around debugging/monitoring and configuration complexity. Enhancements like a Unified Observability Tab, Simplified IAM Helper, Streamlined Trigger UI, Enhanced Test Tab, and Contextual Help aim to address these pain points directly. This is hypothesized to reduce friction, decrease errors, speed up debugging cycles, and improve developer satisfaction, ultimately benefiting AWS through reduced support costs, better adoption/retention, and stronger platform leadership.",
