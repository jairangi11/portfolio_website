*   Connect 'Prediction API' to 'Website/Mobile App', 'Logistics Operations Monitoring Dashboard', and 'Support Agent Unified View'.
*   Show interaction arrows between 'Website/Mobile App' and 'Order Management', 'Notification Service'.
*   Indicate relevant data flow from 'Order Management System' potentially feeding initial order data.
*   Connect 'Support Agent Unified View' as being part of 'Customer Support CRM'."

**Goal:** Visualize the key components and data flow relationships of the proposed system.

## 2. Customer Order Tracking User Flow

**Category:** Flowchart

**Prompt:**
"Create a flowchart illustrating the user flow for a customer checking their order status on the Flipkart app after tracking enhancements.

**Flow Steps:**

1.  **Start:** Customer Opens Flipkart App.
2.  **Action:** Navigate to 'My Orders'.
3.  **Action:** Select a specific order.
4.  **Process:** Order Details page loads.
    *   *(Sub-Process):* UI makes API calls to 'Tracking Query API' and 'EDT Prediction API'.
5.  **Display:** Show Enhanced Tracking Section containing:
    *   Visual Progress Bar/Checklist.
    *   Current Standardized Status (e.g., 'Shipped', 'Out for Delivery').
    *   Detailed Chronological Tracking History (list).
    *   Dynamic Estimated Delivery Time Window (e.g., 'Today, 3 PM - 5 PM').
6.  **Decision:** Is Status 'Out for Delivery' AND Map Data Available?
    *   **Path (Yes):** Display Real-time Map View.
    *   **Path (No):** Continue to Step 7.
7.  **Decision:** Is a significant delay detected by the system?
    *   **Path (Yes):** Display Delay Reason (if available).
    *   **Path (No):** Continue to Step 8.
8.  **End:** Customer views accurate status and EDT.

**Alternate Flow Branch:**

1.  **Start:** Customer Receives Proactive Delay Notification (Push/SMS).
2.  **Action:** Customer taps notification.
3.  **Process:** App opens directly to the Enhanced Tracking Section of the relevant order (Equivalent to Step 5 above).
4.  **End:** Customer views updated status, EDT, and delay reason."

**Goal:** Illustrate the primary path and key information displayed to the customer during tracking, including a notification-triggered entry point.

## 3. Support Agent WISMO Resolution Flow

**Category:** Sequence Diagram

**Prompt:**
"Create a sequence diagram showing the interaction between a Support Agent, the Customer Support CRM, and backend services when resolving a 'Where Is My Order' (WISMO) query.

**Participants:**
*   Support Agent
*   Customer Support CRM (Unified Frontend/Backend Component)
*   Tracking Data Aggregation Service (API)
*   EDT Prediction Service (API)

**Sequence of Interactions:**

1.  **Agent -> CRM:** Receives WISMO query and searches Order ID.
2.  **CRM -> Tracking Service API:** Request Tracking Data (Order ID).
3.  **Tracking Service API -> CRM:** Respond with Standardized History & Delay Codes.
4.  **CRM -> EDT Prediction Service API:** Request Current EDT (Order ID, context).
5.  **EDT Prediction Service API -> CRM:** Respond with Accurate EDT Window.
6.  **CRM -> CRM:** Consolidate Tracking, EDT, Delay info into 'Unified Tracking View'.
7.  **CRM -> Agent:** Display Unified Tracking View.
8.  **Agent -> Agent:** Reviews accurate, real-time information.
9.  **Agent -> (Customer):** Communicates status, EDT, and reasons to the customer.
10. **Agent -> CRM:** Mark query as resolved."

**Goal:** Show the system interactions enabling faster and more accurate support responses by consolidating necessary data for the agent.

## 4. Data Flow for EDT Prediction

**Category:** Flowchart / Data Flow Diagram

**Prompt:**
"Create a data flow diagram (visualized as a flowchart) illustrating how the Estimated Delivery Time (EDT) is generated and updated.

**Entities/Data Stores:**
*   Tracking Data Aggregation DB
*   Historical Delivery DB
*   Real-time Traffic API
*   Weather Forecast API
*   EDT Prediction ML Model
*   Prediction API Endpoint
*   Customer UI / Agent View

**Flow 1: Initial Prediction**

1.  **Trigger:** Order Dispatch Event occurs.
2.  **Action:** EDT Prediction ML Model reads data from:
    *   Historical Delivery DB (baseline performance)
    *   Order Details (Origin, Destination, Product Type - implicitly available)
3.  **Process:** Model generates Initial EDT.
4.  **Action:** Initial EDT is stored (associated with order).
5.  **Action:** Initial EDT is made available via Prediction API Endpoint.

**Flow 2: Dynamic Update**

1.  **Trigger:** New relevant Tracking Event arrives in Aggregation DB (e.g., Reached Hub, Out for Delivery, Delay Scan).
2.  **Action:** EDT Prediction ML Model reads data from:
    *   Aggregation DB (latest events)
    *   Historical Delivery DB
    *   Real-time Traffic API
    *   Weather Forecast API
3.  **Process:** Model generates Updated EDT.
4.  **Action:** Updated EDT overwrites previous EDT (associated with order).
5.  **Action:** Updated EDT is made available via Prediction API Endpoint.

**Flow 3: Consumption**

1.  **Trigger:** Customer UI or Agent View needs to display EDT.
2.  **Action:** UI/View requests latest EDT from Prediction API Endpoint.
3.  **Response:** Prediction API Endpoint provides the current stored EDT."

**Goal:** Explain the process and data sources involved in generating and dynamically updating the delivery prediction.
